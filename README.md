# ParallelImageProcessing
 Parallel Image Processing Algorithm by Using Threads
 
 **Description:**
 
In this project, we learned to use parallel image processing algorithm by using threads. Digital images 
are containing various types of noises which are reduces the quality of images. Noises can be 
removed by various techniques. Smoothing is often used to reduce noise within an image. For each 
pixel, we will perform a smoothing operation by taking the sum of the neighboring pixels and finding 
the average. We will use the OpenMP library and functions to do this in parallel.
